This directory carries the handoff protocol specification and conformance assets as part of the Tabura publication set.

Primary goals:
- keep the object-scoped UI paradigm as the top-level product framing
- keep transport/protocol contracts versioned and citable in the same public repository
- avoid split publication timing across multiple repos for core interoperability specs
